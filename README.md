# 🥗 Diet Recommendation System using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **Diet Recommendation System** built using **Machine Learning** techniques to provide personalized dietary suggestions. 
It uses **K-Means Clustering** to segment users based on health features and a **Random Forest Classifier** to recommend appropriate diet plans. 
The application features a **FastAPI** backend, an interactive **Streamlit** frontend, and is fully containerized with **Docker** for easy deployment.

## 🧠 ML Algorithms Used

### 1. K-Means Clustering
- Groups users based on input features (e.g., age, BMI, activity level)
- Enables cluster-wise diet recommendation logic

### 2. Random Forest Classifier
- Predicts the best-fit diet plan for users
- Trained on historical diet and health data
